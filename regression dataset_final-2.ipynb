However, it's important to understand the purpose of such borrowing at this age could be due to them needing to buy things such as homes which necessitate loans, irrespective of income level.

This dataset provides clear, distinct links between the variables and \"Class\".\nTo ensure reliable results, I removed outliers and data with None values. Outliers throw of modelling and the graphs, so it was in my best interest to remove them for more reliable data.\n\nAfter data cleaning, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the \"age\" and \"credit_amount\" variables. Through scatter plots and other visualisations, I uncovered a relationship between age and credit amount. Specifically, a significant number of individuals between 20 to 40 years old had credit scores below 4000. This observation suggests an interaction between age, credit usage, and financial stability, which could be significant in understanding credit risk.\n\nAnother important aspect I found while exploring the data was the distribution of job classes. Using bar plots, I visualised the spread of job classes, which helped me gain insights into the different job categories in the dataset. Understanding the job-class distribution is essential to comprehending credit risk and its connection to various occupations.\n\nLastly, I analysed the relationship between credit history and creditworthiness. Through appropriate visualisations, I observed that individuals with existing or multiple credit lines tend to have better credit since having credit leads to a better credit score, indicating the value of responsible credit management in assessing credit risk.\n\nThe EDA process proved invaluable in uncovering trends and patterns that provided insights into credit risk evaluation. Overall we can see that there is a complex relationship between credit behaviour and creditworthiness, which will be vital in the subsequent steps of model training and evaluation in later parts. With a better understanding of the dataset, I am now well-equipped to build a robust credit risk prediction model that takes into account various factors to assess individuals' creditworthiness accurately.\n\n\n",
