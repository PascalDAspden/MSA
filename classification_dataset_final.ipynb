Whereas company_size, experience_level and employment_type contributed the most when predicting the salary of people in the data science field.\n\nMy exploration of the data and preprocessing began with loading the salary dataset into the pandas data frame. This dataset provides a comprehensive insight into the salaries of data science professionals and how it varies based on different factors.\n\nIn order to ensure the quality of the data, the cleaning process involved removing outliers from the dataset. I implemented a function that removes any data point more than three standard deviations from the mean in the numeric columns. This step was vital because outliers can significantly skew results and impact the predictive performance of machine learning models.\n\nFollowing the data cleaning, I performed statistical analysis on the 'salary_in_usd' field. By calculating the mean and standard deviation, I was able to determine the dispersion of the salaries, which provided an understanding of the overall salary distribution.\n\nThe next step involved diving deeper into the data through visualisations. These included box plots and bar plots, which I used to compare salaries against variables such as company size, experience level, and employment type. This phase was crucial in visualising trends and patterns in the data that would not be evident from just looking at raw data, meaning the best variables were easier to identify.\n\nSome of the interesting findings from the EDA included:\n\nA correlation between company size and wages became obvious when graphing the features, with smaller companies generally paying less than larger ones while medium ones pay the most.\nWhen examining the data, there was a clear impact of experience level on salaries, with more experienced professionals ('EX') earning more.\nThere was also a variation in salaries based on employment type, with full-time roles usually offering higher salaries than part-time ones.\nThrough preprocessing the data, I developed a thorough understanding of the datasets, revealing essential insights that will guide the subsequent steps in model training and evaluation. These insights include identifying key features and their potential influence on predicting salary outcomes.\n",
